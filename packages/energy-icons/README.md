# energy-icons

Open-source icons for the energy transition. MIT licensed. Browse them all at [energyicons.com](https://energyicons.com).

```bash
npm install energy-icons
```

React 18 or newer is required.

```tsx
import { Icon } from "energy-icons/icon";

<Icon name="pylon" size={32} weight="bold" />
```

That import includes every icon. To ship a single drawing:

```tsx
import { Pylon } from "energy-icons/icons/pylon";

<Pylon size={32} />
```

Sizes below 32 use the 20px master. Sizes from 32 up use the 48px master. `weight` is `"regular"` (the default) or `"bold"`. Icons inherit `currentColor`.

SVG files ship in the package at `energy-icons/svg/<slug>/`.

## Icon font

No build step or React needed. Add the stylesheet, then add classes.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/energy-icons@1/font/style.css" />

<i class="ei ei-wind"></i>      <!-- regular -->
<i class="ei-b ei-wind"></i>    <!-- bold -->
```

Icons take their size from `font-size` and their colour from `color`. To load one weight only, use `font/regular/style.css` or `font/bold/style.css`. The font uses the 20px master. Codepoints are listed in `energy-icons/codepoints.json` and never change between releases.
