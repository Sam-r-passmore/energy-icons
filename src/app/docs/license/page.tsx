      <DocSection title="How the icons are made">
        <P>
          Icons are drawn in Figma by Sam, and extended with Claude working from the same construction rules and
          grid. Every icon is reviewed and finalised by hand before it ships.

      <DocSection title="Trademarks">
        <P>
          A few icons depict symbols associated with trademarks, such as Bluetooth, USB, Wi-Fi and EV connector
          standards like CCS and CHAdeMO. These marks belong to their owners. Their inclusion is for identification
          only and implies no affiliation or endorsement. Follow the owner’s guidelines when you use them.
